Quick is an efficient, fast, microblogging framework built on graphql. 

## Inspiration

I thought it'd be extremely cool to have something like the blogging framework that Zuckerberg used while [building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPazh2kDdvA) Facesmash. Immediately, twitter and some other microblogging sites come to mind, but, there are a few issues

1. The code is not customizable to your needs
2. Everything is public, and accessible to everyone. A huge concern to privacy enthusiasts
3. It's slow and bloated, due to the large number of trackers that they put up.

So this is an alternative, that is self hostable.
